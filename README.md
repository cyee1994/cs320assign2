CS320 Assignment #2 README
 
This project consists of 4 different simple C programs with functions varying from just printing out some words to taking command line arguments and using them in a program. 

prog2_1.c outputs my name. It is compiled using gcc prog2_1.c and run using ./a.out

prog2_2.c prompts a user for their name and then greets the user. It is compiled using gcc prog2_2.c and run using ./a.out

prog2_3.c prompts the user for a non-negative integer then calculates the tan of that integer. It is compiled using gcc prog2_3.c -lm and run using ./a.out

prog2_4.c takes in 2 command line arguements, the first being the number of elements of a sin wave to produce and the second being the distance in degrees between each element. It is compiled using gcc prog2_4.c -lm and run using ./a.out x y with x and y being two positive integers.
